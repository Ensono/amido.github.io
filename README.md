# Shared templates and files

We have created default [health templates and files](.github) that will be used for any public repository. 

> GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:
  > * the root of the repository
  > * the .github folder
  > * the docs folder
  
> For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a public repository under [Amido](https://github.com/amido/) organisation that does not have its own CONTRIBUTING file will see a link to this repos [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). If a repository has any files in its own .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder, including issue templates or a config.yml file, none of the contents of the default [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) folder will be used.
