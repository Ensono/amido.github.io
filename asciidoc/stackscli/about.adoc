= Using the Ensono Stacks CLI

The Ensono Stacks CLI is built using Go, which means that it is a single binary that can be downloaded and run without the need to run an installer. It is currently built for the following platforms:

* image:./images/icons/windows.png[Windows]
* image:./images/icons/apple.png[Mac OS]
* image:./images/icons/linux.png[Linux]

The CLI will help you get started with scaffolding your applications and workspaces using Ensono Stacks! Through a series of questions, the CLI will determine how and what to build for your workspace, helping to accelerate your development process!
