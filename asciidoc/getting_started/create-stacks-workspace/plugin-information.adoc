= @ensono-stacks/create-stacks-workspace

Create a new Ensono Stacks Nx workspace. Using the create-stacks-workspace script will quickly allow you to initialize a new NX workspace with the Ensono Stacks recommended plugins, packages and configuration to get started on a new project quickly.

The Ensono Stacks `create-stacks-workspace` script will

- Run Nx https://nx.dev/packages/nx/documents/create-nx-workspace[create-nx-workspace] command to setup a new NX workspace passing along any command line arguments provided
- Install any recommended plugin/generators/executors from Ensono Stacks. If the `next` preset is selected the link:/docs/getting_started/next/ensono-stacks-next[Ensono Next plugin] will be installed. With all presets the link:/docs/getting_started/workspace/ensono-stacks-workspace[Ensono Workspace Plugin] will be installed. (see link:/docs/getting_started/create-stacks-workspace/ensono-stacks-create-stacks-workspace#presets[presets])
- Configure the NX workspace. This will involve updating the NX.json file with any information provided from the command line arguments
- Execute recommended generators from Ensono Stacks to initialize the workspace/projects depending on the options provided.
- Create an e2e test project if this option was selected

== Setting up @ensono-stacks/create-stacks-workspace

=== Execution

Run the *@ensono-stacks/create-stacks-workspace* with the following command including any options see link:/docs/getting_started/create-stacks-workspace/ensono-stacks-create-stacks-workspace#command-line-arguments[command line arguments]:

----
 npx @ensono-stacks/create-stacks-workspace@latest
----

=== Presets

On running the script you will be asked for a monorepo preset with the following options

----
apps              [an empty monorepo with no plugins with a layout that works best for building apps]
next.js           [a monorepo with a single Next.js application]
----

Each preset will install, configure and run any recommended plugins for that specific preset. For example the next.js preset will run the https://nx.dev/packages/next[NX NextJS] plugin application generator as well as the link:/docs/getting_started/next/ensono-stacks-next[Ensonso Stacks NextJS] init plugin generator.

We do not support react and currently only support nextjs, therefore if you want to create a nextjs workspace with a client side rendered application, you must use Nx and not Ensono Stacks.

*You will then be asked which test runner to include for e2e testing:*

1. none: Creates your application without an e2e test project
2. playwright: Installs the link:../playwright/plugin-information.md[@ensono-stacks/playwright] plugin and creates an e2e test project for your application using playwright.
