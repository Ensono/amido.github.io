== Axe: Accessibility testing

From the Deque family of products, we are using link:https://www.deque.com/axe/[aXe] for accessibility testing. When developing, we expect to support WCAG 2.1 Level AA ["wcag21aa"] at a minimum.

aXe tests are performed on two levels:

1. Rendering the React component and testing with Jest.
2. Rendering the entire page and testing with Playwright.
