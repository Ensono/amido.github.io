Visual Regression testing or Visual testing in software is a quality assurance activity of verifying if the visual aspects of the applicationâ€™s user interface seem appropriate to the user. It is also known as Visual Validation Testing.

Visual Regression testing can be implemented using a variety of tools and languages and is a fast way of checking defects of front end applications. For more information on Visual Regression testing, you can look at this article link:https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/visual-validation-testing/[Here].

== Visual Regression Testing with Applitools Eyes

=== Pre-requisites

An Applitools eyes account - link:https://applitools.com/[Applitools]

== Getting started

We are using link:https://applitools.com/[Applitools] with Cypress for visual testing. For Ensono Stacks, we have configured the framework to use the free tier, which gives:

- 1 user (normally the pipeline)
- 100 checkpoints per month

Eyes-Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to add eyes commands to your TypeScript tests.

The configuration file has been added to the `tsconfig.cypress.json`

=== Running Applitools in Cypress

In order to run Cypress with Applitools, you will need an link:https://applitools.com/[Applitools] account. Once signed up (there is a free tier), the API key can be used to create a connection with Applitools.

Please follow the link:https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html[Cypress Tutorial]

[source,bash]
----
export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=KEY_VALUE
----

=== How to run the tests locally

To spin up the server locally, running Cypress headless, use:

----
npm run test:cypress:eyes
---- 

This is the same for running in CI pipelines.

=== Where Applitools tests should be located

The `*.test.eyes.cy.ts` tests are located with the page compositions (a composition is several components that may come together to form a page).
