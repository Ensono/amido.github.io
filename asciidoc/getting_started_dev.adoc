= Dev [Node.js] - Using the repo to build the Node.js application

== Getting started

=== Bootstrapping a WebApp

As a general rule, the steps to get one of our npm environments up and running are as follows:

For local execution:

1. Clone the project and navigate to the relevant path.
2. Run the following commands in the following order:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
npm run build
npm run build:watch
npm npm run start
----

All of our packages, including the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amidostacks/scaffolding-cli[npm: @amidostacks/scaffolding-cli], are available on link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amidostacks/scaffolding-cli[npm].

See the README for more information on generating the templates from the CLI: link:https://github.com/Ensono/stacks-webapp-template/blob/master/packages/scaffolding-cli/README.md[packages/scaffolding-cli/README.md].

Once built, when starting the server and webapp, a browser window should open up and automatically navigate you to the local instance, but if not, the default URL is link:http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000].
