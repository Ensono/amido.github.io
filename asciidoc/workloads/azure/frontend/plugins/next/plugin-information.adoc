== Using next with Ensono Stacks!"

The `next` plugin contains generators to augment existing NextJs projects. Adding eslint rules, testing config as well as installing and configuring NextAuth.js in your NextJs app.

Using a standard setup for your Next app ensures consistency and code quality across multiple applications quickly. NextAuth (alongside Redis) can also be quickly added to a project without costly configuration and setup.

Using the deployment generator you can setup your application with the necessary infrastructure config to host it in k8s.

== Prerequisites

An existing link:https://nextjs.org/[Next] application. Note the generator will fail if run in an empty workspace with no applications. To create a new Next application please run the NX Next generator with the following command including any relevant options. See link:https://nx.dev/packages/next[@nx/next plugin docs]

[source, bash]
nx g @nx/next:app my-new-app

Ensure the `stacks` -> `executedGenerators` fields are present within `nx.json` for FE code generation.

Ensure the `stacks` -> `config` fields are present and populated within `nx.json` for deployment/infra generation.

An example of the expected structure can be link:/docs/getting_started/workspace/ensono-stacks-workspace#prerequisites[seen here] under `@ensono-stacks/workspace:init`â€‹ prerequisites.

== Setting up @ensono-stacks/next
