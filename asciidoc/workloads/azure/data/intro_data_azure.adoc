The https://github.com/ensono/stacks-azure-data[Ensono Stacks Azure Data Platform] solution provides
a framework for accelerating the deployment of a production-ready modern data platform in Azure.

1. Use the link:../../stackscli/about.adoc[Ensono Stacks CLI] to generate a new data platform project.
2. Build and deploy the data platform infrastructure into your Azure environment.
3. Accelerate development of data workloads and ETL pipelines with link:./etl_pipelines/datastacks.adoc[Datastacks].

The Ensono Stacks Data Platform delivers a modern Lakehouse solution, based upon the link:./etl_pipelines/etl_intro_data_azure.adoc#medallion-architecture[Medallion Architecture], with Bronze, Silver and Gold layers for various stages of data preparation. The platform utilises tools including **Azure Data Factory** for data ingestion and orchestration, **Databricks** for data processing and **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for data lake storage.

Key elements of the solution include:

- Infrastructure as code (IaC) for all infrastructure components (Terraform).
- Deployment pipelines to enable CI/CD and DataOps for the platform and all data workloads.
- link:./etl_pipelines/datastacks.adoc[Datastacks] - a library and CLI built to accelerate the development of data engineering
workloads in the data platform.
- A framework for link:./etl_pipelines/data_quality_azure.adoc[data quality validations].
- link:./etl_pipelines/testing_data_azure.adoc[Automated tests] to ensure quality assurance and operational efficiency.
- Sample link:./etl_pipelines/ingest_data_azure.adoc[data ingest pipelines] that transfer data from a source into the landing (Bronze) data lake zone.
- Sample link:./etl_pipelines/data_processing.adoc[data processing pipelines] performing data transformations from Bronze to Silver and Silver to Gold layers.
