## Overview

Tests where possible will be written and delivered as part of the same branch and feature. Where this is not possible, in the event of using a standalone repo or the alternative, we expect the same development and code reviews standards to be upheld, and the branch naming to be aligned with the development branch name as possible.

### Pre-commit Tests

To be run on the local active develop branch, before commit. Before committing changes, we suggest enforcing and running pre-commit tests with a pre-commit hook.

### Pre-deployment Tests

To be run on the active development branch.
After which, we have two different processes, one for pre-deployment tests (unit, snapshot, integration), and another for post-deployment (functional tests).  Pre-deployment tests can run on the fly whilst coding. This is enabled by using a ‘watch-mode’ which will check for code changes, compile/trans-compile, and run the tests against the web app.

### Post-deployment Tests

To be run on master once the pull request (PR) has been approved and passed all pre-deployment tests.

## Quality Gates

The following demonstrates the series of quality gates that the web app must pass through in order to successfully be deployed to a user facing environment (production).

### Jest: Unit, Component and Snapshot Testing

We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running all unit, component,
integration and snapshot tests. Jest supports TypeScript via Babel. Because
TypeScript support in Babel is transpilation, to ensure that Jest will
type-check the tests as they are run we use
[ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).

To help that encourage good testing practices for React DOM testing, we are
leveraging a helper library [react-testing-library](https://jestjs.io/).

### Scripts

`npm run test`: To run all unit tests. This will also run any snapshot tests.
Snapshots are to be checked in and are found in
[**snapshots**](__tests__/__snapshots__).

## Cypress: Functional Tests

> Keywords: Functional automation, End to End, E2E

We are using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) for functional testing as much
as possible. The key features of Cypress:

- Integration testing with API testing support (Node.js)
- Easy debugability (DOM snapshotting)
- Selector playground
- Great documentation
- Best implementation of Live Reloading

### Why is Cypress categorised in the pre-deployed tests

The Cypress tests, if structured correctly, can be run BEFORE the app client is deployed to an environment. This is to ensure that we get the fastest feedback we can. If you are following branching strategies such as GitFlow, then you can run these tests on your branch before merging to master.

| BENEFITS  | DOWNSIDES |
| ---       |  ---      |
| deployment independent | not full integration tests as not running on deployed infrastructure|
| faster feedback |  |
| run core tests before the branch is merged to master, smoke tests post-merge and deployment |  |

### How is Cypress run in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines

Glad you asked. You'll see an npm script in the `package.json` which uses [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test). This package starts the Node.js Express server, waits for the app URL (localhost in this case), then runs test command; when the tests end, it shuts down the server instance.

Key benefits means we never have to explicitly wait for the server to be ready before testing.

_package.json script_:

```json
"test:cypress": "env CI=true node_modules/.bin/start-server-and-test start $APP_BASE_URL:$PORT test:cypress:run"
```

### How do I use Cypress

Please read
[Cypress - Best Practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html)
for how to get the most out of Cypress.

### How can I use Cypress while I develop

#### Server Side Rendered (SSR) Apps

Say if you are following Test Driven Development (TDD) cycles, or if you wish to write a failing test for a known bug, and fix the app and check to ensure that the test passes, you may wish you watch the tests and the code together.

To open and run Cypress locally with live reload, after installing dependencies:

1. Install app dependencies `npm install`
2. Build the web app `npm run build`
3. Compile the `*.cy.ts` Cypress test files `npm run test:cypress:compile`
   (optional: pass `--watch` through to watch for changes)
4. Start the server, run the tests headless, tear down the server:
   `npm run test:cypress`. When writing tests: Open Cypress with live-reloading
   and selector playground `npm run test:cypress:open`

### How do I run all the tests without keeping the server running

#### Server Side Rendered (SSR) Applications

To spin up the server automatically, then run Cypress in headless Chrome, use:

_Script_:

`npm run test:cypress`. This is the same script as mentioned for running in [CI pipelines](#how-is-cypress-run-in-continuous-integration-ci-pipelines)

### Where should tests be located

We suggest co-locating the `*.cy.ts` tests with the page compositions (a composition is several components that may come together to form a page). for high-level tests, and component tests with the components themselves.

e.g.

compositions
├── create
│   ├── index.test.cy.ts
│   └── index.tsx
└── home
    ├── __snapshots__
    │   └── index.test.tsx.snap
    ├── components.tsx
    ├── index.axe.test.tsx
    ├── index.test.axe.cy.ts
    ├── index.test.cy.ts
    ├── index.test.eyes.cy.ts
    ├── index.test.tsx
    └── index.tsx

### How to configure the environments

We suggest tightly coupling Cypress with the app under test. This means sharing environment configuration files. This ensures that in your deployment pipelines, and quality gating process, you are confident that the app under test is being tested correctly.

For example, if an API URL changes, you will only have a single place to change and the tests and app will be updated together.

 Note that the environment variables are required on the hosting platform, e.g.
`export NODE_ENV=dev`

## Axe: Accessibility Testing

From the Deque family of products, we are using
[aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) for accessibility testing. When developing, we
expect to support WCAG 2.1 Level AA ["wcag21aa"] at a minimum.

aXe tests are performed on two levels:

1. first by rendering the React component and testing with Jest.
2. second with Next rendering the entire page and testing with Cypress.

Both examples are in the scaffolded web app templates: <https://github.com/amido/stacks-webapp-template/tree/master/packages/scaffolding-cli/templates/src/ssr>

### Cypress: Debugging Axe Failures

> When accessibility violations are detected, your test will fail and an entry titled "A11Y ERROR!" will be added to the command log for each type of violation found (they will be above the failed assertion). Clicking on those will reveal more specifics about the error in the DevTools console.
Source: [cypress-axe#standard-output](https://github.com/avanslaars/cypress-axe#standard-output)

For information on how to fix the failure, follow the HelpUrl printed to the console.

## Applitools: Visual Tests

> Keywords: visual regression testing, browser support, cross-browser

We are using the [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) with Cypress for visual testing. For Stacks, we are just using the free tier. But we suggest discussing your requirements and what this means for your team. The free tier only gives:

- 1 user (normally the pipeline)
- 100 checkpoints per month

Eyes-Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows
you to add eyes commands to your TypeScript tests. The configuration file has
been added to the [tsconfig.cypress.json](./tsconfig.cypress.json).

### Getting started

In order run Cypress with Applitools, you will need an [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) account. Once signed up (there is a free tier), the API key can be used to create a connection with Applitools.

Please follow the incredible [Cypress Tutorial](https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html) for how Applitools and Cypress go together like pumpkin and pie.

`export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=`

### How can I run the tests locally

To spin up the server locally, running Cypress headless, use:
`npm run test:cypress:eyes`. This is the same for running in CI pipelines.

### Where should Applitools tests be located

The `*.test.eyes.cy.ts` tests are located with the page compositions (a composition is several components that may come together to form a page). 

## Static Analysis

There is support with [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) for static analysis.
We can run this with Amido Stacks custom container, supports running Sonar Scanner for .NET and NPM projects. 
[amidostacks/ci-sonarscanner](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/amidostacks/ci-sonarscanner).

This container make running static code analysis a breeze in the pipelines.

To run, the export the followings environment variables for the
SonarCloud Project:

```bash
export SONAR_TOKEN=
export SONAR_PROJECT_KEY=
export SONAR_ORGANIZATION=
export BUILD_NUMBER=
```

To find this, please ensure that you sign up with GitHub to
[Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io) for the Organisation under test.

First generate the code coverage results but running the unit tests, then run the SonarCloud scanner and
push up the results for analysis.

```bash
npm run test
docker run -e SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonarcloud.io -e SONAR_TOKEN=$SONAR_TOKEN -e SONAR_PROJECT_KEY=$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY -e SONAR_ORGANIZATION=$SONAR_ORGANIZATION -e BUILD_NUMBER=1.2.3 -v $(pwd):/usr/src --rm -it amidostacks/ci-sonarscanner /bin/bash -c 'cd /usr/src && sonar-scanner'
```

## Consumer-Driven Contract Testing with Pact

Consumer-Driven Contract (CDC) Testing is a pattern that allows a consumer (i.e:
a client) and a provider (i.e. an API provider) to communicate using an agreed
contract (a pact).

The following documentation is an overview of the Pact implementation as part of the templated SSR web app. See [packages](../packages/packages.md) for a link to the source code.

_Note: The `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks in Jest is not before all tests but
before each file._

### [Utils](./utils)

These are reusable components that can be used for any Javascript consumer setup with pact-js.

We are using Jest to wrap pact-js to create the interactions and
generate the Pacts for the web app as a consumer. Following the examples on
[pact-js](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js).

There is full documentation for how contract testing works available on the
[Pact website](https://docs.pact.io/how_pact_works).

A global 'provider' variable is set up in the [pactSetup.ts](./utils/pactSetup.ts)
file. Then the [pactTestWrapper.ts](./utils/pactTestWrapper.ts) ensures each test
file will have the provider setup for them.

The `pactFileWriteMode` option been set to `update` in the provider that the
pacts append to. Please see
[pactFileWriteMode](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/ruby/configuration#pactfile_write_mode)

```bash
# Export the Consumer and Provider names when running locally, or define in Azure Pipelines Library
export PACT_CONSUMER= \
export PACT_PROVIDER=
```

```bash
# Generate and verify pacts against mock
npm run test:pact
```

Due to the afterAll hooks in Jest not invoking after all tests, but before each
file, there is a [pactPublish](./utils/pactPublish.ts) script to publish the
pacts to the configured broker.

```bash
# Export broker credentials for running locally, or define in Azure Pipelines Library
export PACT_BROKER= \
export PACT_BEARER_TOKEN= \
```

```bash
# Publish the pacts to the configured broker
npm run test:pact-publish
```

### Pact Stub Service

Pact contracts are easily turned into locally running API stubs. They are great
for use as a simple service to run integration tests against, whether with
Jest, or with Cypress. This ensures that you can test your application without
hitting the actual endpoint, and ensures the same response every time, without
duplicating mock definitions.

If gives the consumer confidence that if the contract tests are passing with the
provider, then the mocks should suffice to test parts of their application
against.

No more updating stub responses that go out of date. Hooray!

The Pact files (.json) are generated when the Pact tests are run
(`npm run tests:pact`), and are published to the broker on succeeding. To get the latest pact file to generate the stub service from, you can either:

1. Run the tests, which will output the Pact .json files to
   [**tests**/pacts](./__tests__/pacts)
2. Pull down the latest passing contracts from the broker
   (`https://PACT_BROKER/pacts/provider/PROVIDER/consumer/CONSUMER/latest`)

Once the files are sourced, it's as simple as starting the stub service either
from the npm script in CI, or by calling the
[pactStubServer.ts](./pact/packStubServer.ts) from your test.

```bash
# To start the Pact stub server
npm run test:pact-start-stub
```

To test the server:

```bash
# To test that the service is running and returning expected responses:
curl -v localhost:8389/v1/menu/e98583ad-0feb-4e48-9d4f-b20b09cb2633 -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Please remember to always stop your server once done testing.

### Can I Deploy

The [Can I Deploy](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy) tool ensures you are safe to deploy your application. Before deploying to a new environment, you need to know if the version is compatible with the provider version. Instead of checking the broker, we can poll the broker and check programmatically with the latest versions.

```bash
# Run can I deploy using the pact-js SDK
# This is called in the pipeline
npm run test:pact-can-i-deploy-ci
```

```bash
# Run can I deploy using the pact CLI
npm run test:pact-can-i-deploy-cli
```

*Example output:*
This demonstrates that the consumer is safe to deploy, and will return exit code 0 (this means yes!).

```bash
INFO: Asking broker at https://amido-stacks.pact.dius.com.au if it is possible to deploy
INFO: pact-node@10.5.0/10589 on AML0160.local: 
    Computer says yes \o/ 
    
    CONSUMER            | C.VERSION           | PROVIDER | P.VERSION      | SUCCESS?
    --------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|---------
    GenericMenuConsumer | 0.0.213-test-report | MenuAPI  | 1.5.190-master | true    
    
    All required verification results are published and successful
```

### Pact working Example

We have included a Pact test which will deploy to a PactFlow broker, and verify against the MenuAPI .NET API. This is to ensure that there is an example working test that can be used as a reference.

Example ENV_VARS:

```bash
export PACT_BEARER_TOKEN=
export PACT_BROKER=https://amido-stacks.pact.dius.com.au
export PACT_CONSUMER=GenericMenuConsumer
export PACT_PROVIDER=MenuAPI
```

Maintainers and contributors may obtain the `PACT_BEARER_TOKEN` if they request access to the PactFlow instance. Else, this will be run in the Azure DevOps Pipeline.

#### Tests

[get-menu-by-id.test.pact.ts](./get-menu-by-id.test.pact.ts) is an example test. This calls the [menuServive](./mocks/menuService.ts) Menu API when running locally.

When the tests pass, the contract will be written to [pacts](./pacts/genericmenuconsumer-menuapi.json), following the naming convention: `<PACT_CONSUMER>-<PACT_PROVIDER>`.

Some good practices:
✅ Use Pact Matchers to ensure we account for state change, e.g. no hardcoded values for menus in the database, see <https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/matching> for more information.
✅ Ensure that the provider state has been configured by the Provider

It's important to get the `PACT_CONSUMER` and `PACT_PROVIDER` names correct, as these form the key for verify.

⚠️ /pacts: these are checked in for reference only. Please do not change the outputted .json files. They are created on successful test runs by Pact. These will be published to the broker upon successful run in the pipeline, with the corresponding version tags.
