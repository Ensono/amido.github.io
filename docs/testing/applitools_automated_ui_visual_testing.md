Visual Regression testing or Visual testing in software is a quality assurance activity of verifying if the visual aspects of the applicationâ€™s user interface seem appropriate to the user. It is also known as Visual Validation Testing.

Visual Regression testing can be implemented using a variety of tools and languages and is a fast way of checking defects of front end applications. For more information on Visual Regression testing you can look at this article [Here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/visual-validation-testing/)

## Visual Regression Testing with Applitools Eyes

### Pre-requisites

An Applitools eyes account - [Applitools](https://applitools.com/)

## Getting started

We are using [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) with Cypress for visual testing. For Stacks, we have configured the framework to use the free tier, which gives:

- 1 user (normally the pipeline)
- 100 checkpoints per month

Eyes-Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to add eyes commands to your TypeScript tests.

The configuration file has been added to the `[tsconfig.cypress.json](./tsconfig.cypress.json)`.

### Running Applitools in Cypress

In order run Cypress with Applitools, you will need an [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) account. Once signed up (there is a free tier), the API key can be used to create a connection with Applitools.

Please follow the nvm [Cypress Tutorial](https://applitools.com/tutorials/cypress.html)

 ```bash
`export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=KEY_VALUE`
 ```

### How to run the tests locally

To spin up the server locally, running Cypress headless, use:
`npm run test:cypress:eyes`. This is the same for running in CI pipelines.

### Where Applitools tests should be located

The `*.test.eyes.cy.ts` tests are located with the page compositions (a composition is several components that may come together to form a page).
