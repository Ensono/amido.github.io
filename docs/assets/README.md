# Docusaurus assets

As per the [Docusaursus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/doc-markdown#linking-to-images-and-other-assets), static assets used in documents and blogs should go into `docs/assets` and `website/blog/assets` respectively.

To reduce the size of the monorepo, we instead insist on ALL assets to be hosted publically.
