## Templated Pipelines

Whilst there is a full CI/CD process for contributed changes to ensure existing functionality doesn't break if you want to ensure your PR passes, please follow the steps in the [templated-cli](../packages/packages.md) docs to create a templated out app with and *-pipeline.yml and point to your own CI/CD tooling.

All changes need to be made inside the `packages/scaffolding-cli/templates/build/*`.

Azure Devops (TFS) ONLY:

- The generated pipeline yaml is only comprised of steps and jobs templated out from other repo 

### Basic Guide 

<!-- Add more steps. -->

1. See [publishing](../packages/npm/publishing.md) for how to publishing changes to packages


### Build container definitions

All build containers used by the pipelines are stored and managed from `libs/images/*`, should you need to change or create an additional one please follow the existing structure and create a folder for your specific use case.

These are meant to be used for public consumption and should not include any secrets or keys left in the container.

DO NOT use `COPY` or `ADD` commands.

e.g. create a folder called `pip-cypress` and within it include a Dockerfile and a README.
