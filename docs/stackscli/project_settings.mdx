# Project Settings

Each project that is supported by the Stacks CLI have a settings file associated with them. This is called, by default, `stackscli.yml`. It is possible to override the actual file that is used as well as the filename.

The settings file is intended to allow the project maintainers to define what steps needs to be done on a project and instruct the CLI what to do, without having to refactor the CLI.

## Structure

The following table details the structure of the settings file.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                     | Example | Allowed Values |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| `framework`        | The framework that the project is based on.                                     |         |                |
| `pipeline`         | This is a list of the supported pipelines and the associated files              |         |                |
| `init.operations`  | List of operations that need to be performed on the temporary project directory |         |                |
| `setup.operations` | List of operations that need to be performed on the project directory           |         |                |

> **Note**

> **Important**
> 
> It is possible to ignore the results of the version check when the CLI is running by using the `force` option, but remember that it is a destructive operation and it will delete any existing projects that exist in the same path.

Not all version numbers conform to semantic versioning. For example Java tends to add characters to the version number, e.g. `1.8.0_301`. To get around this the CLI tries to make the version semver compliant by removing the `_`, so the version tested will be `1.8.0301` which is a valid semver.

The next table shows the options for the operations.

## YAML File

The following code listing shows an example settings file.

**Example project settings file.**

``` yaml
framework:
  name: dotnet 
  commands: 
    - name: dotnet 
      version: ">= 3.1, < 3.2" 

pipeline:
  - type: azdo 
    files:
       - name: build 
         path: build/azDevOps/azure/azure-pipelines-netcore-k8s.yml
       - name: variable 
         path: build/azDevOps/azure/azuredevops-vars.yml
    replacements: 
        - pattern: ^.*myvalue$
          value: Foo Bar

init: 
  operations: 
    - action: cmd 
      args: new stacks-docs -n {{ .Input.Business.Company }}.{{ .Input.Business.Domain }} 
      desc: Create a project using the "stacks-docs" project 

setup: 
   operations:
```

  - Sets the framework that the commands should be run for

  - Specify the commands for which the version number should be checked

  - The name of the command to get the version number for

  - The version constraint that the version number should be checked against

  - Specify the pipeline that is being targeted

  - Name and path to the build pipeline file in the repository, for the specified pipeline system

  - Name and path to the variable template in the repository

  - List of replacements that should be made in the specified build file

  - Perform operations on the temporary project directory

  - List any number of operations that need to be performed

  - States the action that needs to be performed

  - The arguments that need to be passed to the framework command, in this case `dotnet`

  - Description of the operation, this will be displayed in the log output when the CLI is executed

  - Define operations that need to be performed after the project has been created

This example shows one action that needs to be performed on the project before it has been created in the user specified working directory.

## Examples

The GO template package is very powerful and allows advanced configuration in a settings file. This section shows some examples of what can be achieved.

### Setting a default value

The framework properties that can be specified on a project allow extra information to be specified in the CLI configuration that is passed to the template. This information does not have to be set, but a default value maybe required in the template.

For example, in the `stacks-dotnet-cqrs-events` project we need to be able to pass in `servicebus` or `eventhub` based on the selection from the user. However if this selection is not made then the project settings file should still work as expected. It is not possible to default the property to a known value as these properties will be used by other languages, so the value needs to have a default in the template.

To achieve this the `or` template function needs to be used. This function takes values and will use the first value that has been set.

The following listing shows a snippet of the project settings file for a project.

**Setting default value using Go template.**

``` linenum
- action: cmd
  cmd: dotnet
  args: new stacks-cqrs-events-app -n {{ .Input.Business.Company }}.{{ .Input.Business.Domain }} -o {{ .Project.Directory.WorkingDir }} -e {{ or .Project.Framework.Properties.Prop1 "servicebus"}}
```

In this example all of the values for the parameters come from the `.Input` or `.Project` object (as detailed in the [???](#_templating) section).

The last parameter to be set is defined as `{{ or .Project.Framework.Properties.Prop1 "servicebus" }}`. This will set the `-e` parameter to the value set in the property if that is set or default to "servicebus".
