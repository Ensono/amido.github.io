We're working on adding workloads for GCP at the moment. Currently there is one available:

- Server-side rendered webapp in JavaScript / NodeJS and React

However, we haven't documented this so for the moment it's unsupported. If you're interested you can access it by selecting *GCP > server side rendered webapp* in the CLI tool. To understand how the CLI works you'll have to check out the [CLI documentation on one of the other workloads](https://stacks.amido.com/docs/workloads/azure/frontend/cli_webapp_frameworks).

Currently roadmapped for GCP are these workloads:

- REST web API with CQRS in both C#/.NET and Java/SpringBoot
- Event listener in both C#/.NET and Java/SpringBoot
- Client-side rendered webapp in JavaScript / NodeJS and React

Contact stacks@amido.com for more information.
