We recommend using Visual Studio Code as IDE, although feel free to use any other you may wish.

## Extension Recommendations

These extensions are not required, but they provide features that we find helpful while developing

- [EsLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - To lint the code according to be practices
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - To Format the code in a standardized way
- [Eslint-Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint) - Allows eslint to be aware of prettier rules
