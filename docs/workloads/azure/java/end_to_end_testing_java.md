## Getting started

Serenity BDD provides excellent integration with Selenium, which allows you to avoid a lot
of the boilerplate and infrastructure code you normally need to deal with in automated web tests.
In particular, Serenity manages the driver lifecycle for you (so you don't need to create your own driver
instances, or close them at the end of the tests).

Serenity can also be configured to automatically take screenshots throughout the tests, creating rich documentation
of how each test played out. When you write your tests in a fluent, readable manner, these screenshots
become part of the "living documentation" of your application.

## Configuration
