## Build and Run the application

<br />

The API generated consists of configuration to be run locally or on a docker container.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<details open>
<summary>Build and run locally</summary>

<div>

<Tabs
groupId="operating-systems"
defaultValue="windows"
values={[
{label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
{label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
]}>
<TabItem value="windows">

Move to the `<PROJECT-NAME>/src/api` folder and run the next commands in **Command Prompt** or **Powershell**

```bash
dotnet build
```

```bash
# Note that the template engine will rename your paths, so change the command accordingly
dotnet run --project xxAMIDOxx.xxSTACKSxx.API/xxAMIDOxx.xxSTACKSxx.API.csproj
```

:::note Potential issue on some Windows installations
Depending on how deep your folder structure is you might encounter a problem where you cannot build the project. This happens because of our dependency on [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/) for our contract tests.

The error looks something like this

```shell
Error MSB3491 Path: File exceeds the OS max path limit. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters.
```

There are two fixes possible so far:

- You must enable long file paths on Windows by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=powershell#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later)
- Create your folder on an upper level where the paths won't exceed 260 characters

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux">

Move to the `<PROJECT-NAME>/src/api` folder and run the next commands in **terminal**.

```bash
export COSMOSDB_KEY=<COSMOSDB_KEY value here>
export SERVICEBUS_CONNECTIONSTRING=<Your Service Bus connection string here>
export EVENTHUB_CONNECTIONSTRING=<Your Event Hub connection string here>
export STORAGE_CONNECTIONSTRING=<Your Event Hub storage connection string here>
```

```bash
dotnet build
```

```bash
# Note that the template engine will rename your paths, so change the command accordingly
dotnet run --project xxAMIDOxx.xxSTACKSxx.API/xxAMIDOxx.xxSTACKSxx.API.csproj
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</div>
</details>

<br />

<details>
<summary>Build and run in docker container</summary>

<div>

From the `<PROJECT-NAME>/src/api` folder, build a Docker image using e.g. the command below:

```bash title="Build docker image"
docker build -t dotnet-api .
```

This uses the **Dockerfile** in this folder to generate the Docker image.

After the creation of the Docker image, the Docker container can be run using the command below:

```bash title="Run docker container"
docker run -p 5000:80 --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/PROJECT-NAME/src/api/xxAMIDOxx.xxSTACKSxx.API/appsettings.json,target=/app/config/appsettings.json -e COSMOSDB_KEY=your-key -e SERVICEBUS_CONNECTIONSTRING=your-asb-connection-string -e EVENTHUB_CONNECTIONSTRING=your-aeh-connection-string -e STORAGE_CONNECTIONSTRING=your-aeh-storage-connection-string  dotnet-api:latest`
```

:::note
The **COSMOSDB_KEY** described in the command above has to be passed when running the container. **SERVICEBUS_CONNECTIONSTRING** OR **EVENTHUB_CONNECTIONSTRING** and **STORAGE_CONNECTIONSTRING** are needed based on the configuration and message service you'll be using. Note that the **appsettings.json** value is mounted here for running locally,
but not if the full project is deployed to Azure, where the build process will perform the substitution.

:::note Relationship between domain and path

Keep in mind that if you've changed the domain (original being `Menu`), the path will reflect that. If your domain is `Foo`. Then the path will be `../v1/
foo` instead of `..v1/menu` etc.

Browse to [http://localhost:5000/v1/menu](http://localhost:5000/v1/menu). This should return a valid JSON response.

The application configuration uses Swagger/OAS3 to represent the API endpoints. The Swagger UI can be viewed by directing your
