## Overview

This page present the high level design of the reference implementation of the .NET Ensono Stacks REST API with CQRS.

<ResponsivePlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8FW-djEDDY'>

**This page assumes that the core infrastructure has already been provisioned. Instructions and additional information on the core infrastructure can be found [here](../../../../infrastructure/azure/core_infrastructure.md)**

Both the diagram and resource list below are for a single environment.

**\*** _Resource is created by the core infrastructure deployment._

## Deploying

All infrastructure is deployed using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) that is included with the generated code.

### Pipelines

The following pipelines are currently supported for automating the deployment:
