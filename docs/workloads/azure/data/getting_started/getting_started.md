A more [detailed workflow diagram](../architecture/architecture_data_azure.md#detailed-workflow) is also available.

## Steps

1. [Infrastructure Deployment](core_data_platform_deployment_azure.md) - Generate and deploy a new Stacks Data platform
2. [Local Development Quickstart](dev_quickstart_data_azure.md) - Once your project has been generated, setup your local environment to start developing
3. [Shared Resources Deployment](shared_resources_deployment_azure.md) - Deploy common resources to be shared across data pipelines
4. (Optional) [Example Data Source](example_data_source.md) - To assist with the 'Getting Started' steps, you may wish to setup the Example Data Source
5. [Data Ingest Pipeline Deployment](etl_pipelines_deployment_azure.md) - Generate and deploy a data ingest pipeline using the Datastacks utility
