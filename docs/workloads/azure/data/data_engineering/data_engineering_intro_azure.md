Ensono Stacks accelerates the generation of production-ready data engineering workloads and pipelines for a data lakehouse. New data engineering workloads can be generated through the [Datastacks](./datastacks.md) utility, while a range of example data workloads and pipelines are also provided. These workloads cover all stages from ingesting data from source, applying data transformations across data lake layers, ultimately enabling end-user data visualisations and analytics.

## Lakehouse approach

The Ensono Stacks data platform is based upon a _Lakehouse_ architecture. This approach combines the benefits of both data warehouses and data lakes, to provide a platform that is fully scalable, flexible and performant, along with governance and management capabilities. It can support all use cases, from complex machine learning to standard BI reporting and analysis.

### Medallion architecture

The data lake structure in Ensono Stacks is based upon the
[medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) design pattern. The default data lake deployed through Ensono Stacks contains the following data layers:

| Data lake layer | Description | Default container name | Data format | Stacks workload type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bronze | The initial landing area where data is stored as per its original source, prior to any transformations. | raw | Parquet | [Data ingest](./ingest_data_azure.md) |
| Silver | The data has been cleansed, validated and stored in an optimal format to support downstream analytic use-cases. | staging | Delta | [Data processing](./data_processing.md) |
| Gold | Reliable data entities prepared for specific use-cases. These typically combine and aggregate datasets from the silver layer. | conformance | Delta | [Data processing](./data_processing.md) |

### Fabric lakehouse

[Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/) can be used as the lakehouse layer in an Ensono Stacks data platform. Fabric provides an all-in-one analytics experience, with a range of tools for data analysts, data engineers and data scientists. It also closely integrates with Power BI. Full details on getting a Fabric lakehouse up and running with your Ensono Stacks data platform are in the [getting started](../getting_started/fabric_deployment_guide.md) section.

## Datastacks

[Datastacks](./datastacks.md) is a library and CLI built to accelerate the development of data engineering workloads in the data platform. It features a range of utilities to enhance the process for developing and deploying production-ready data pipelines and workloads.

## Quality assurance

Quality and reliability of data workloads are at the core of Ensono Stacks data platform. This is ensured through frameworks for [data quality](./data_quality_azure.md) and [automated testing](./testing_data_azure.md).

## Sample dataset

The example workloads included in the solution are based upon an
[example Azure SQL data source and dataset](../getting_started/example_data_source.md). This data source may optionally
be deployed as part of the data platform, to allow full demonstration testing of these example workloads.
