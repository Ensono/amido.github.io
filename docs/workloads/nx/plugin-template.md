Summary of the plugin
What is it's purpose?

What benefits does it give you?

## Getting Started

To get started with `plugin-name` you can use it in through the interactive mode or directly through command line arguments!

### Interactive mode 
To run the `plugin-name` generator in interactive mode run the following command:
```bash
Command to run plugin-name
```

Upon running the above command you will be asked the following questions:
```
√ Example Q1                            · Maps to --Option1
√ Example Q2                            · Maps to --Option2
```
### CLI Options

As an alternative to interactive mode, arguments can also be specified alongside the above command:

```bash
Command to run plugin-name --Option1 Option1Value --Option2 Option2Value
```
The following command line arguments are available:

| Option | Description | 
| ---   | ---------------------------------   |
| --Option1 | Option 1 description/possible values |
| --Option2 | Option 2 description/possible values | 

### Generator Output
##### What is the output of the above commands?
Will it create new files, will it manipulate existing ones?


```text title="Example of files being generated"
.
├── main folder created
│   ├── file which gets created
│   ├── second file which gets created
└── second folder created
```

##### Has it installed any additional plugins? 
What are they? Can we link to docs about the additional plugins?

#### Has it created any scripts?
How do we use them, what do those scripts do?
e.g
```json title="Example script that's created"
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  },
```  

### [plugin-name] features

Are there any additional features to this generator which you can use after it's initial creation?
E.g can you use it to "bump versions", does it have additional nested generators with it's own set of capabilities?
