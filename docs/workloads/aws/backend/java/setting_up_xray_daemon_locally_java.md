## Introduction to AWS X-Ray

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices 
architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify 
and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. 

X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. 
You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices 
applications consisting of thousands of services.

## AWS X-Ray Daemon

The AWS X-Ray daemon is a software application that listens for traffic on UDP port 2000, gathers raw segment data, and relays 
it to the AWS X-Ray API. The daemon works in conjunction with the AWS X-Ray SDKs and must be running so that data sent by 
the SDKs can reach the X-Ray service.

To run the X-Ray daemon locally, on-premises, or on other AWS services, you need to download it from the  [AWS X-Ray Daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html) support page, 
run it, and then give it permission to upload segment documents to X-Ray.

### Giving the daemon permission to send data to X-Ray

The X-Ray daemon uses the AWS SDK to upload trace data to X-Ray, and it needs AWS credentials with permission to do that.

On Amazon EC2, the daemon uses the instance's instance profile role automatically. Locally, save your access keys to a file 
named `credentials` in your user directory under a folder named `.aws`.

#### Example ~/.aws/credentials

```text
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

### Running the daemon

Run the daemon locally from the command line. Use the -o option to run in local mode, and -n to set the region. The download
page linked in the text above gives specific instructions on how to run the daemon on supported operating systems.

For the MacOS distribution, the command is as follows (assuming the AWS London region is being used): - 

```bash
~/Downloads$ ./xray_mac -o -n eu-west-2
```

### X-Ray daemon logs

The daemon outputs information about its current configuration and segments that it sends to AWS X-Ray.

```

## Adding AWX X-Ray Support to the codebase

AWS X-Ray support is enabled through the inclusion of the `stacks-module-parent` dependency that imports the Spring Cloud
support for AWS; at some point the use of AWS- and Azure-specific libraries are to be tidied up, so it is likely that at 
that point a specific AWS module will need to be included.

The code currently uses Spring AOP to add a pointcut to all Controller methods under the `com.amido.stacks` package so no 
manual intervention is necessary.

It is possible to enable or disable AWS X-Ray support using the following environment variable prior to starting the application: -

```bash
~/Stacks$ export AWS_XRAY_ENABLED=true
```

The AWS X-Ray SDK will fail quiescently if no authentication is provided, or if the Daemon is not running. Please check the output
of the X-Ray daemon logs initially (see above) if traces do not seem to be arrving in CloudWatch.

## Viewing X-Ray Traces in the AWS Management Console

Once the daemon has been setup and started any REST API controller methods should start to push trace information to the 
AWS Management console for the account whose credentials are being used.

Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch section. On the toolbar on the left you should see a section
entitled **X-Ray traces**.

Expand this section and choose the **Service map** option. You should start to see information about REST API calls that have
been made - you can click on the **Traces** entry to see more detailed information.
