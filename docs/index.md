## What is Stacks

Stacks is an Amido open-source project that automates the setup of software development projects. Stacks is for software engineers of all kinds who want to create projects quickly.

Setting up the infrastructure and frameworks necessary to deliver a software project takes time. A team might spend the first two weeks (sprint 0) making technical decisions and then provisioning and configuring environments, pipelines, compute, test frameworks and more. Stacks automates this setup using code-as-infrastructure to shrink your project's sprint 0 from two weeks to an hour or less.

## What can you do with Stacks

Most software delivery projects start with a series of technical decisions:

- Which cloud provider should I use?
- What solution architecture do I need to build?
- What language should I code in?
- What test framework,
- ...CI/CD pipeline,
- ...and compute should I use?

Taken together your tech choices in these six areas are what Stacks calls a *Workload*. For example:

- On Azure (cloud provider)
- I want to build a REST API (solution architecture)
- Written in Java (language)
- Using JUnit / Karate as a test framework
- and GitLab as a CI/CD pipeline
- with AKS and Docker / Alpine compute

When you run Stacks it presents you with options in each of these six areas. Then it instantly generates your chosen workload, complete with sample applications and cloud provisioning, if that's what you've selected. All the technical overhead is done so you're ready to start coding.

Stacks currently offers 15 unique workload variations with another 40 roadmapped. What are they? Explore the [What can you do with Stacks?](../#stacks-selector) element [on the home page](https://stacks.amido.com/) to find out.

## Why use Stacks

By massively shrinking sprint 0 Stacks gets you productive very quickly. First time users should be up and running in an hour. Familiar users, with all the required software installed and cloud accounts set up, can get a boilerplated solution up and running in the cloud in five minutes.

But there's more to Stacks than saving time. Amido has thought deeply about the technology choices Stacks offers. Our long experience of delivering successful projects means we know which technologies work well and which work best together.Â This experience has informed our choices of platforms, services and functions that Stacks offers, which means that using Stacks reduces risk. You can be totally confident that the test frameworks Stacks offers when you're building a REST API in Java, or the CI/ CD pipelines for your C# event listener, or the compute options for your Node SSR web app are going to work well.

## How does it work
