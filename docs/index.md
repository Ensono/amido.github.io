## Why we are developing Stacks

Stacks enables teams to gain momentum on digital transformation.
It helps de-risk project delivery, and enables project teams to focus on solving business challenges, rather than technical overheads.

## What Stacks is

Itâ€™s like a show house, built given what we know now, our skills, abilities, resources and tools available.

The internal layout of the house might change.
The house might move location.
It might not even need a roof!

With the solid foundations and structure built, the team can decorate and customise the house for their client.

## How we have approached Stacks

* Open source first
* Re-usable and configurable boilerplates
* Cloud first

Amido has been building solutions for over 10 years in varied industry segments to solve domain-specific problems. Most of these specialised solutions require lots of research and validation before it can become a viable product. Amido doesn't want to spend time re-inventing solutions for problems that are common on many projects.



To stay relevant and keep the focus on domain-specific problems, instead of technology implementations, Amido Stacks identifies the common requirements in new projects and contributes open-source resources to reduce risk and save time.



Behind each of our tooling and implementation choices, is an Architectural Decision Record (ADR). These records form a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. For each record, we have taken the time to research the offerings, obtain the most appropriate decision at the time, and support this with a proof of concept (POC).

The following list is a snapshot of all the records that have been taken into account. These are constantly being reviewed and added to overtime.

### Deployment concepts

The deployment principles of build once then deploy to multiple stages has been applied as best practice for the generated pipeline template.
Templated out pipeline will encompass the build, deploy dev, deploy prod stages. Each stage is comprised of tasks that the user can either enable or disable depending on their setup and currently available tooling such as SonarCloud or vulnerability scanning.
